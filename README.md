# Design of Digital Differentiator Using AOS Algorithm**

This repository contains the implementation and design of a digital differentiator using the Atomic Orbital Search (AOS) algorithm. The AOS algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of atomic orbitals in quantum mechanics.

## Design of Digital Differentiator

The digital differentiator is a fundamental signal processing component that approximates the derivative of a discrete-time signal. It is widely used in various applications such as image processing, audio signal analysis, and communications systems.

The implementation in this repository focuses on designing a digital differentiator using the AOS algorithm. The AOS algorithm provides an efficient and robust approach to optimize the coefficients of the differentiator filter.
